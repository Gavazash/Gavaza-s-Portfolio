<h1>About Me</h1>
<P>My name is Gavaza Shikwambana, and I am proud to share my life journey.
   I am happily married to the love of my life, Mashudu Phalanndwa,
   in a same-sex marriage that has blossomed beautifully for 19 wonderful years.
   Together, we have built a life filled with love, joy, and countless memories.</P>

<P>Our family is our greatest treasure. We are blessed with two beautiful children—twins
   named Gundo and Mukhethwa—who are 7 years old. They bring endless laughter, light,
   and love into our lives, and we cherish every moment we share with them.
   As parents, we strive to give them the best foundation to thrive while showering 
   them with unwavering affection.</P>

<P>Professionally, I have dedicated my career to the banking industry, where I have amassed extensive experience 
  and honed my skills over the years. Recently, however, I have discovered a newfound passion for the world of computing,
  development, and machine learning. This exciting journey into technology has opened up new opportunities for growth
  and exploration, and I am embracing it wholeheartedly.</P>

<p>Family means everything to me, and I wouldn’t trade this incredible journey for anything in the world.
   Love truly is the cornerstone of our lives, and I hold my family close to my heart.</p>
